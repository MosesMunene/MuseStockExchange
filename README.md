# MuseStockExchange

#Synopsis
A stock exchange platform modeled after the Narirobi Securities Exchange. 
This provides the REST API. See https://github.com/MosesMunene/MuseStockExchange-web for web client.

#Motivation
 - To experiment with Service Oriented Architecture and get familirized with pitfalls, gotchas and design patterns of the approach.
 - To explore JavaEE features that I had not explored (JAX-RS).
 - To brush up on JavaEE features (try new approaches)
 - To experiment with AngularJS (1.5.8) and get familirized with pitfalls, gotchas and design patterns of the approach.
 - Also, I am tired of Java Server Faces.
